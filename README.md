Hi, this is my 611 Data Science Project. My dataset is an open dataset on Kaggle which includes 70000 records of patients data and 11 features, which you might find in data folder. 

In this case, I would like to invest the relationship between Cardiovascular diseases and biographic information like age, smoke, etc. I plan to apply machine learning method to do prediction.

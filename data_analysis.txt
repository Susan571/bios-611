Linear Discrimnant Analysis, Logistic Regression, and Adaboost will be used to model the dataset. 
Using Linear Discriminant Analysis, the auc is 0.702760468332397 for the testing set. 
Using logistic regression, the auc is 0.783840488083617 for the testing set. After a stepwise variable selection, the auc is 0.783841708072271 with only four variables: heart_disease, hypertension, avg_glucose_level, and age. 
Using adaboost, the auc is 0.783840488083617 for the testing set. 
 Using Linear Discriminant Analysis, the auc is 0.702760468332397 for the testing set. 
Using logistic regression, the auc is 0.783840488083617 for the testing set. After a stepwise variable selection, the auc is 0.783841708072271 with ten variables: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, smoking, alcohol intake, height, glucose, physical activity, weight, cholesterol, age .

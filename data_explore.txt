The dataset contains the following 13 variables: id, age, gender, height, weight, ap_hi, ap_lo, cholesterol, gluc, smoke, alco, active, cardio. 
Let us first take a look at the discrete (categorical) covariates. There are 45530 females, 24470 males in the dataset. For the smoking status, 63831 never smoked, 6169 smokes in the dataset. There are 66236 never drunk alcohol, 3764 drinks alcohol in the dataset. There are 13739 without physical activities, 56261 with physical activities in the dataset. There are 35021 does not have presence of cardiovascular disease, 34979 has the presence of cardiovascular disease in the dataset. For the Cholesterol status, 52385 is normal level, 9549 above normal level, 8066 well above normal. For the Glucose status, 59479 is normal level, 5190 above normal level, 5331 well above normal. 
Let us then take a look at the continuous covariates. For the age arrange, the minimum is 10798 and the maximum is 23713. The median is 19703, which is clearly more than the mean 19468.87, indicating that the distribution is left skewed. For the height arrange, the minimum is 55 and the maximum is 250. The median is 165, which is clearly more than the mean 164.36, indicating that the distribution is left skewed. For the weight arrange, the minimum is 10 and the maximum is 200. The median is 72, which is clearly less than the mean 74.21, indicating that the distribution is right skewed. For the weight arrange, the minimum is -150 and the maximum is 16020. The median is 120, which is clearly less than the mean 128.82, indicating that the distribution is right skewed. For the weight arrange, the minimum is -70 and the maximum is 11000. The median is 80, which is clearly less than the mean 96.63, indicating that the distribution is right skewed.
